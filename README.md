This is my second project with html and css. However, this website is much more developed and advanced compared to my first project.

I referenced a website on pinterest and made it entirely on my own, adapting to my own style and theme as well. 

The general theme of this website is once again: a travel blog (in Japan).

With this project, I exposed myself to further complicated css where I:

- made a transparent navigation bar
- worked with flexboxes to create cards and a footer 
- transform an image's color
- experimented with gradidents on images

Overall still a pretty simple project but just more time spent on. Next project I will look forward to making a responsive website, this site kinda wacky when you start to change dimensions
